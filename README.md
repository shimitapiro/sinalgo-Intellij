# sinalgo-Intellij
Sinalgo working in Intellij, You might need to change the path for the project structure but otherwise you should be good


Changed the configuration of the binaries for
sinaglo to be the default intellij path, Meaning once you start sinaglo it will look for the
binaries at the default intellij output folder that should be at <u>out/production/sinaglo-work</u>

Added the ability to create new projects :
<ol>
<li>To add new sample project copy past it to the projects folder - Better to simply copy one of the exaplmes and change it,</li>
<li>Then build artifact to create the binaries for sinaglo build->Build Artifact</li>
<li>Then run the project, The new project should show in the GUI</li>
</ol>
**Added that it will build artifact on Run**
