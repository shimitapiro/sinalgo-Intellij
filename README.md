# sinalgo-Intellij
Sinalgo working in Intellij, You might need to change the path for the project structure but otherwise you should be good

Added the ability to create new projects :
Changed the configuration of the binaries for sinaglo to be the default intellij path
To add new sample project copy past it to the projects folder - Better to simply copy one of the exaplmes and change it,
Then build artifact to create the binaries for sinaglo, Then run it should show in the sample GUI
